# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to market volatility. This project aims to build a **Stock Price Prediction** model using  **Machine Learning** techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of historical stock price data with features such as:
- Open Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Close Price
- Volume
- Date/Time Index

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Models Used:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Jupyter Notebook** / Google Colab for experimentation

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🔍 Model Training & Evaluation
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering & selection
   - Normalization using MinMaxScaler
   - Creating time-series sequences for LSTM
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Train traditional models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Implement an LSTM-based deep learning model
   - Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy
   
3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared Score
   
📊 **Results:** The LSTM model achieves the lowest RMSE on the test dataset.
